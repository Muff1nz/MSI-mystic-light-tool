# MSI-mystic-light-tool

Open project to implement our own led effects for Mystic Light-enabled MSI products

You may know that MSI has released a [C# SDK](https://msi.com/Landing/mystic-light-motherboard#extension) to embed led control in third-parties applications. As the official Gaming App doesn't support much effects (and in my case, I'm limited to 7 colors), I'm planning to code a customizable led tool to get the most out of our leds :)

UPDATE (16/11): I've actually tested the library. It needs Mystic Light to be installed, as such, it only supports a few MSI products, and my gear is not in the list. I'll just post some stubs on how to use it I think, as I'll never be able to test it.
For reference, here's a link to [Mystic Light 1 installer](http://download.msi.com/uti_exe/Mystic_Light.zip), and another one to [Mystic light 2](http://download.msi.com/uti_exe/Mystic_Light_2.zip). 
This should be the supported hardware list:
