# MSI-mystic-light-tool

Open project to implement our own led effects for Mystic Light-enabled MSI products

You may know that MSI has released a [C# SDK](https://msi.com/Landing/mystic-light-motherboard#extension) to embed led control in third-parties applications. As the official Gaming App doesn't support much effects (and in my case, I'm limited to 7 colors), I'm planning to code a customizable led tool to get the most out of our leds :)

NOTE: This is currently a placeholder repo as in this period I'm rather busy with my studies, but I'm planning to start working by the end of November
